From start to finish, Solomon was always available to answer any questions that we had. He sat down with us and explained the process step by step. His team was efficient and clean during installation and the workmanship was beyond beautiful. We are so amazed at how our roof turned out. What a difference it makes and it definitely is a show stopper. We are at ease knowing our home is protected. Thank you so much and we will definitely be referring Solaris Roofing to our family and friends. What a job well done!",
